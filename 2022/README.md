### Day 12
> Pathfinding using dijkstra algo, used wikipedias definition of
> the algorithm to make my own implementation. It feels slow, come
> back to this in the future and improve performance.

### Day 13
> Using serde json to parse input into a custom Enum `Node`.
> Implementing the `Ord` and `PartialOrd` traits to sort a vector of `Node`
> Implementing a custom `Debug` fn to print `Node`

### Day 15
> Parsing strings with nom. Struggled a bit with performance in part 2.
> Another one to possibly come back to in the future. Not so much Rust
> issues though.
